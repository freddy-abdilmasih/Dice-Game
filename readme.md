**DICE GAME**

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- Each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, they lose their entire ROUND score and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points in GLOBAL score wins the game!
